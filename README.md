# The Treasuers's Site
A web app to help school treasurers manage their class funds(or whatever it's called). This project is mostly complete with minor features left unimplemented.
This is an abandoned project :)
There is an incomplete user manual included :)

A lot of code refactoring is needed to maintain the codes. This was my first personal project in PHP.
